        <h1>Bass Deafness</h1>

        <p>Soon after I picked up the bass, Eric, a guy from my college dorm, announced in a moment of sincere confusion, "It's not like anyone would know it's missing if it weren't there." The summer before, when I was planning to stop renting and actually buy my first Squire Precision from the Highwood guitar store, my father said much the same thing at the kitchen table. He was supportive, indulged my instincts, but, as with many things, didn't seem to get my particular interest, and said, "I just don't see why anyone would want to play the bass."</p>
        
        <p>In fact, most people don't know what the bass player adds to a song; or rather, they do not know how to listen for the bass's structural contribution. They can tap their feet, they can dance, they can feel their adrenaline surge or their heart rates slow, but when it comes to knowing what in the music is compelling those reactions, they simply shrug.</p>
        
        <p>The ideal bass line in a blues song is felt more than heard, as necessary to the groove as a roux is to gumbo. But like a roux, the line itself isn't exactly a flavor. Since so much of popular music is derived from the blues, it stands to reason that the bass line in everything from "Jailhouse Rock" to "Smells Like Teen Spirit" should also come from the same tradition: it gives motion to and reinforces the major or minor quality of the chord and threads together the larger chord progression.</p>
        
        <p>The bass speaks more to our bodies than to our conscious minds; its simplicity and ubiquity seems beneath our need to notice.</p>
        
        <p>One might wonder, then, as long as the listener identifies in some way with the emotional world behind the song—a wonderful and necessary feeling—does it matter what he or she is consciously aware of? Coleridge once said that poetry could be experienced even while it is imperfectly understood; the same applies to music, both in terms of the larger tradition and to a song's component parts. Yet Coleridge's wisdom goes only so far in helping me explain why I'm now hearing what I'm hearing at this particular point in my life. Something in my brother's death has put these concerns before me.</p>
