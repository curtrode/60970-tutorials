      <h1>Bass Deaf</h1>
      <p>An essay about music, family, and finding one's place in the larger song</p>
    </div>
    <div class="essay-text">
      <p>The bright November Sunday after my brother's memorial service near Chicago, I packed up my rented Corolla, not with books or pictures or baseball mitts or the other expected knickknacks of the dead, but with musical gear: a classical guitar, a newly purchased Stratocaster, two amplifiers, a box of pedals and effects, a drum machine, a four-track tape recorder, and a microphone. Instead of spending the better part of this last summer writing, I spent it sorting through that equipment, testing the cables for shorts, figuring out which knobs do what, even composing song fragments on my computer. In the most literal way, as if I didn't know it already, Todd's musical life has become my inheritance.</p>
